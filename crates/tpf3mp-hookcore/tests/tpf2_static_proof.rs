//! Static proof of the resolver against a real game binary.
//!
//! Resolves the TPF2 build-35924 profile against the executable on disk and
//! checks that every target is found at its known RVA, uniquely, and that a
//! modified copy is refused. The executable is READ-ONLY: this test only reads
//! it. It is skipped when the file is absent (for example in CI).
//!
//! Scanning the on-disk file is a development convenience. It is valid here
//! because build 35924's `.text` is not encrypted (the SteamStub `.bind`
//! section leaves the code readable on disk), which this test's exact prologue
//! matches confirm. The production resolver scans the running process's mapped,
//! unpacked module image instead - the same [`resolve`] call, a different byte
//! source (see `docs/HOOKS.md`).
