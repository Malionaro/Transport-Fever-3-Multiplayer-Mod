-- tpf3mp/progression.lua -- how the room's companies rank up when there is
-- more than one (docs/DECISIONS.md, D23 proposed).
--
-- Transport Fever 3's own rule (build 40408, game_mechanics/company/,
-- investigation/TPF3_PROGRESSION_2026-09-30.md): the company growth script
-- keeps one company, the save's player. Its experience is the highest world
-- population it has seen (the residents of every town, served or not), and
-- its rank the game's thresholds on that, from the population the game began
-- with. With one company in the room nothing here changes that: the game
-- keeps its own score, and a rank the company window takes goes to the
-- growth script as its own event.
--
-- With more than one company each has a score of its own, the sum over the
-- towns of
--
--   population x share x rating / 100
--
-- - population: the town's residents, as the game counts them for its own
--   score (townBuildingSystem.getTown2personCapacitiesMap);
-- - share: the company's share of what was carried for the town: of the
--   cargo delivered to it in the last half year (the game's delivery
--   statistics per line, the window its own delivery rating uses) and of the
--   passengers travelling to and from it on lines (the game's statistics per
--   line, averaged over the same half year here), the two shares weighed by
--   WEIGHTS. A kind nobody carries there does not count;
-- - rating: the company's rating in that town, 0 to 100: the game's town
--   rating (the lowest of its parts, as the towns script computes it) with
--   the two parts a company earns itself taken from its own lines: the
--   happiness of its passengers and how many of its cargo came on time, by
--   the game's own formulas. The other parts (reputation, traffic, noise,
--   pollution) are the town's, the same for every company.
--
-- The score is recomputed four times a game month, at the same game time in
-- every game, from the simulation's state only. As the game's, experience
-- never falls: it is the highest score reached. The rank it reaches is the
-- game's own thresholds (company_progression_util.getLevelAndFraction); the
-- rank taken is the company's, through ApplyRank. The mod's game script
-- keeps it all in its state, which the game saves with the world:
--
--   progression = {
--     quarter = n,                -- the last quarter of a month sampled
--     weights = { cargo =, passengers = },
--     records = { { company = id, entity =, experience =, potential =, level = }, ... },
--     passengers = { { company = id, town = entity, value = }, ... },
