-- tpf3mp/companies.lua -- the room's companies: which company each player
-- plays for, and the Transport Fever 3 player entity each company is.
--
-- A room starts as one company, the save's own player (company 0), which
-- every player plays for (co-op). A player can found a company of their own
-- (`CompanyOp.Create`), join another (`Join`), rename or recolour the one
-- they play for, and dissolve an empty one: any split, two players in one
-- company and one in another included. Every game applies these at the same
-- update, as every other action of the room's (tpf3mp_sim), so every game
-- keeps the same roster; the mod's game script keeps it in its state, which
-- the game saves with the world, so a player who joins or reloads has it.
--
-- A company is a TF3 player entity (`makeGameAddPlayerCmd(name, colour)`):
-- its money is that entity's ACCOUNT, and what it builds and buys is owned
-- by it (PLAYER_OWNED), as the game keeps ownership. Every game creates it
-- at the same update of the same world, so it is the same entity in every
-- game. What the room orders is booked to the acting player's company
-- (tpf3mp/apply.lua), and what another company owns is refused, the same in
-- every game.
--
-- Who may do what (DECISIONS.md, D22, proposed): a company's players build,
-- buy, run lines, borrow, rename and recolour it; its head (the player who
-- founded it while they play for it, else the one who has played for it
-- longest) alone gives it a password or takes it away, sends a player out of
-- it and opens or closes its stations to other companies' lines: by default,
-- and for single companies on their own (`StationAccess`), per company
-- rather than per player, as a company's players share everything it owns.
-- Joining a company with a password needs it: the room seals the password the player
-- typed (tpf3mp_proto::Secret) and every game compares that seal with the
-- one the company keeps, so no game ever holds the password. The room's
-- first company is everyone's: it has no head, no password, and its
-- stations stay open.

-- (docs/HOOKS.md, "Seeds, as built"): alike in every game only while their
-- worlds and game times agree at every room step, which the economy lane
-- checks (tpf3mp/lanes.lua, tpf3mp/subsidies.lua). It keeps them in
